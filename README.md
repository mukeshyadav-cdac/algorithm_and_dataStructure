### 🏗️ **Architecture & Patterns**

#### **SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class and function has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible for new algorithms without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Solution strategies are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces for specific concerns
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level details

#### **Design Patterns**
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different algorithm solutions as strategies
- **Template Method**: Consistent algorithm structure with customizable parts
- **Factory Pattern**: Test runner creation based on programming language
- **Observer Pattern**: Grid updates notify visualization components
- **Composition Pattern**: UI components built through composition over inheritance

#### **React Patterns**
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable stateful logic
- **Compound Components**: Related components working together
- **Render Props**: Flexible component rendering
- **Higher-Order Components**: Cross-cutting concerns

## 🧮 Available Algorithms

### **Dynamic Programming Collection**

#### **1. Unique Paths**
- **Problem**: Find paths in a grid from top-left to bottom-right
- **Solutions**: 4 approaches from O(2^(m+n)) to O(min(m,n)) space
- **Real-world**: Robot navigation, network routing, VLSI design

#### **2. Coin Change**
- **Problem**: Minimum coins needed to make a target amount
- **Solutions**: From exponential recursive to space-optimized DP
- **Real-world**: Currency exchange, vending machines, resource allocation

### **Solution Approaches Explained**

#### **🔄 Recursive (Educational)**
- **Time**: Exponential - O(2^n) or worse
- **Space**: O(depth) recursion stack
- **Use Case**: Understanding problem structure
- **Pros**: Intuitive, mirrors problem statement
- **Cons**: Impractical for real use, stack overflow risk

#### **💾 Memoization (Top-down)**
- **Time**: Polynomial - O(states)
- **Space**: O(states) + recursion stack
- **Use Case**: When recursive structure is valuable
- **Pros**: Natural extension from recursion
- **Cons**: Stack space usage, less cache-friendly

#### **📊 Tabulation (Bottom-up)**
- **Time**: Polynomial - O(states)
- **Space**: O(states) table size
- **Use Case**: Production implementations

#### **⚡ Space Optimized**
- **Time**: Same as tabulation
- **Space**: Optimal - often O(min dimension)
- **Use Case**: Memory-constrained environments
- **Pros**: Minimal memory usage, production-ready
- **Cons**: Harder to understand and debug
